### The History

The Valcasotto palace served different purposes during its long history. It was initially built as a religious monastery for the Carthusians, a Roman Catholic religious order of monks known for their way of life which emphasizes solitude, prayer, and manual labor. After more than 700 years, it was purchased by the royal family, the Savoy. It was transformed into a hunting residence and it was one of the favorite places of Vittorio Emanuele II, the first Italian king. More recently, the Valcasotto palace was acquired by the Piedmont region and it has been opened to the public.

### What to eat
- [Azucar's](https://goo.gl/maps/ANoKaXgrTjqxjCfk8) ice cream: I was positively sursprised by the taste and quality of their ice cream, many particular flavours to try. When an Italian says an ice cream is good you should just try it.

- Stone crabs: Miami is known for its delicious stone crabs, which are caught in the waters off the Florida coast and served chilled with mustard sauce. They are typically in season from October to May.

- Ceviche: Ceviche is a popular seafood dish made with raw fish or shellfish that is "cooked" in citrus juice and seasoned with herbs and spices. It's a refreshing and light option that's perfect for a hot Miami day.

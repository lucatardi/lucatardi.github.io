# Enviroment

To develop an application using Angular some programs and dependencies need to be installed in the machine:

## Code editor

Each library and framework in the web development industry requires a code editor, Angular as well.
My personal choice and preference would be Visual Studio Code but amoung it there are also Atom and WebStorm.

## Terminal

A terminal is a graphic interface which allows us to interact with the computer without having to use the user interface for it. This allows us to run and execute commands by just typing on it.

Most major operating systems come with a default terminal or command-line interface installed. On macOS, the terminal is called **Terminal**, while on Windows, it's known as **Command Prompt**.

## Node.js
Node.js is the platform that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of the web browser. This means, for example, using JavaScript for server-side programming, whether it's on a server or a local computer.

## NPM
NPM (Node Package Manager) is a collection of third-party libraries and modules that can be installed and integrated into Node.js-based projects.

NPM is a fundamental tool for the development of Node.js applications as it simplifies dependency management and makes it easier to use third-party libraries and modules. It is widely used by the Node.js community and represents an essential component of the Node.js ecosystem.

# The Project's Purpose

I firmly believe that learning anything is easier when theoretical concepts are combined with practical application. For this reason, all the theoretical aspects of this course will be accompanied by a practical example.

# The Project

The idea is to develop an interface capable of displaying the latest space launches conducted by SpaceX. We will start by simulating the server's response with a JSON file and populating our UI with its data.

The UI will have a main page where the user can see a list of the latest launches, and we will also add a search function that allows the user to search for specific launches.

Clicking on each launch will lead to a detailed page with all the relevant information.

Finally, we will connect our project to a SpaceX API to obtain real-time information based on the current date.

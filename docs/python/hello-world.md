# Hello World Python ðŸ‘‹

In this lession we will install Python and create the evergreen first program where we will print "Hello, World" to the terminal and we will do it in five steps:

## 1. Install Python
We will first need to install Python on our computer. We can download Python from [the official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions. Once the installation is completed we can validate the correct installation by running the command `Python3 â€”-version` in the terminal.

:::tip
In Python `1.X` and Python `2.X`:
```py
10 / 3 = 3
```
so we really want to download a `3.X` version. ðŸ˜…

## 2. Open a Text Editor 
We can use any text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to write Python code. I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) but there are other options such as Notepad (on Windows), PyCharm, or even a simple text editor like Notepad (on Windows) or TextEdit (on macOS).

## 3. Write the Code
Let's open the text editor and write the following Python code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

This code uses the `print()` function to display the string "Hello, World!" on the screen.

## 4. Save the File
Let's now save the file with a .py extension, for example, `hello_world.py`. let's save it in a location where you can easily find it, the `desktop` would work for example.

## 5. Run the Program
We open a terminal or command prompt on your computer and navigate to `desktop` where our new `hello_world.py` file is saved.

To run the program, we type the following command and press Enter:

```
Python3 hello_world.py
```

You should see the output "Hello, World!" displayed on the screen.

That's it! We've just written and run our first Python program to print "Hello, World!".

# What is Python üêç

Python is a popular and versatile programming language that is known for its simplicity and readability. It's often used for a wide range of tasks, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. Here's a simple way to understand Python:

Python is like a toolbox for computers. It provides a set of easy-to-use tools (functions and commands) that you can use to tell your computer what to do. You can use it to create programs, automate tasks, analyze data, build websites, and much more. The language is designed to be human-friendly, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced programmers.

In summary, Python is a programming language that allows you to communicate with your computer and make it perform various tasks by writing instructions in a clear and straightforward way.

## History

It was invented by Guido Van Rossum in the 1991. While you may know the python as a large snake, the name of the Python programming language comes from an old BBC television comedy sketch series called Monty Python's Flying Circus.

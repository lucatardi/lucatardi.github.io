# What is a component in React

In React, a component is a piece of code that represents a part of a user interface. It can be a simple button, a form, a modal window, a header, or any other element that appears on the screen. Components are reusable, which means that you can use them multiple times in your app.

Components are created using JavaScript functions or classes, and they accept input called "props" (short for "properties"). They always return JSX code.

Components can be combined to create more complex user interfaces. For example, you can use smaller components to build a larger component that represents an entire page. This helps to keep your code organized and easier to maintain.

Overall, components are an important concept in React because they allow you to divide your UI into smaller, reusable pieces that can be managed independently.

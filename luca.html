I am an Italian guy enjoying my life in Dublin. Where during the weekdays I work as a software developer at <a href="https://www.travelport.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Travelport</a> and during the weekends I travel and explore new places. Between one line of code and one flight I like to cook traditional Italian dishes. Oh yes.. in case you have not noticed it yet: I love penguins üêß.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-story">My story<a class="hash-link" href="#my-story" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>I like to think about my life as a set of chapters where each one wraps a specific moment or experience I had, defying who I am in the present day.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-origin">The origin<a class="hash-link" href="#the-origin" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h4><p>I grew up in a small town called <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/FjzhLesAgsbWASZ36" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carcare</a>, where life is simple and slow.
I believe that growing up there helped me a lot to appreciate everything in life.
One of my grandparents was a pastry chef and my other grandpa owned a bakery at some point in his life.
I was so fascinated by their creations and stories that I decided to enroll in a bakery school as part of my secondary studies.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="route-recalculation">Route recalculation<a class="hash-link" href="#route-recalculation" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h4><p>During summer time between the fourth and the last year of school, I found a job in one of the few bakeries in my town, at the beginning, I really enjoyed but only after a few weeks I could not stand anymore the permanent smell I had on my uniform and the almost none human interactions I had during my shift so I decided that was not the career for me. Before finishing school my mom was helping out in a small bar and restaurant which, she told me they were selling.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-challenge">The challenge<a class="hash-link" href="#the-challenge" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h4><p>It was 2009 beginning of a huge economic crisis and I was just 18 when I thought to acquire that business. Thanks to the support and the trust that my dad has always been giving to me during my life I was able to successfully apply for the mortgage and complete the purchase.
The challenge was on, I was still wrapping up my secondary school in the mornings and after that going directly to the bar and starting to work there until closing time. After school was over I felt like to have a bit of free time during my mornings and I ended up spending my time finding ways to innovate the business, we started to organize special dinners and karaoke nights. I was the one monitoring the karaoke activity, investing time in finding the audio files with the best quality and the best program to use for it. This was really my first contact with technology.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-switch">The switch<a class="hash-link" href="#the-switch" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h4><p>I remember at some point I decided to explore the possibility of creating a website for the Bar. I found an online course on YouTube showing how to create a very basic website with a few pages and give a few colors to it and that&#x27;s what I did. After a few weeks, the website was on.
The owner of another restaurant asked me if I could do the same for his business so I remember I charged here 100‚Ç¨ for it. I fell in love with these colorful lines of code so I decided I should try to point my career in that direction.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-new-challenge">A new challenge<a class="hash-link" href="#a-new-challenge" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h4><p>I got an appointment to have some information about a private university that was providing a software and automation engineering course and would allow me to study from home and attend the exams only. The meeting was not good as the lady after asking a few background questions told me that would be difficult for me even to understand the first lessons given the fact I did a bakery school. I remember I felt the effect of these words but even more, I felt my father saying &quot;You always archive what you want to&quot; these words gave me a boost to start the university, studying in the mornings and working in the afternoons and evenings. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hard-time">Hard time<a class="hash-link" href="#hard-time" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h4><p>After a few months of studying, I was ready and confident to undertake three exams: Math 1, Math 2, and English. I failed all of them, I was devasted, and took me a few days to get back on track and find an engineer to get private lessons from him. after that I was able to slowly progress exam after exam, and the university was taking me 5 years instead of the planned 3 years. It was hard to work and study at the same time, I had to merge my social life with my working one inviting my friends to karaoke nights at the bar to be able to see my friends at least while I was working.
When I was close to the finish line I remember I went to Milan for an interview for an internship at <a href="https://atos.net/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atos</a> the interview was not good as the interviewer made me feel uncomfortable talking about not having enough experience for the role. At that time I did not know, only after I realized this was a common pattern in entry level jobs interviews in Italy.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-new-home">A new home<a class="hash-link" href="#a-new-home" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h4><p>A few days later I was at the university waiting for another exam to start and I read a brochure talking about Dublin as the European silicon valley with enterprise companies having a hard time finding software engineers. At that moment I thought that moving to Dublin was the fastest way to a successful career.
I was able to sell the bar, which by the way it is still open and you can find it <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/5H49EppecEMUtHEC7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, complete the studies and get my degree and after three days of my celebration moving to Dublin.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="life-in-dublin">Life in Dublin<a class="hash-link" href="#life-in-dublin" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h4><p>I dedicated my first half year in Dublin in studying English at <a href="https://delfinschool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delfin English School</a> while It was challenging as first time away from my family, friends and country, It was at the same time mindblowing to start to have a commun lenguage to share and learn stories from people coming from complately different cultures.
When I felt my English was enough to start to work in tech I immediately found an internship in a startup called <a href="https://www.outboundsales.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Outbound</a>. The internship was not paid and I had to work during the nights as barback, bringing ice and bottles up and down between floors in a nightclub.
That was only for a few months as after that my carrear started.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="professional-life">Professional life<a class="hash-link" href="#professional-life" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>For a shorter summary of my working experiences you can take a look at <a target="_blank" href="/assets/files/luca-tardito-CV-en-ed4acf45024faa7688c0ec99d9c3332a.pdf">my Curriculum vitae</a>.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cognizant">Cognizant<a class="hash-link" href="#cognizant" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h4><p>I was hired for Cognizant in August 2018 as Web implementation specialist.
My responsabilities were to assist developers to install, use and troubleshoot conversions tracking systems in their websites.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="eshopworld">eShopWorld<a class="hash-link" href="#eshopworld" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h4><p>I started at eShopWorld in middle 2019 as a Junior UI developer.
During my time there I worked across different teams, working at the main checkout platform and in different pricing plugins.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ibm">IBM<a class="hash-link" href="#ibm" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h4><p>I joined IBM in May 2020 as a Front end developer.
At the time I started my team was about to release a new section within the IBM cloud called Security and Compliance, The first relaese went well and we work hard during my time there including an Angular application in the IBM Cloud which was writtent in React.
IBM Cloud was heavly relying on IBM design sysyem and I was daily working with it, being often in contact with their development team, that was the moment I realised I wanted to get involved in the development of a design system.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="travelport">Travelport<a class="hash-link" href="#travelport" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h4><p>I moved to Travelport at the end of 2021 convinced by their project, the people during the interview process. my current job is within their design system team where I am part of the development of a set of packages used by different teams and projects across the organizations.</p></article></div><div class="col col--2"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#about-me" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">About me</a></li><li><a href="#my-story" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">My story</a></li><li><a href="#professional-life" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Professional life</a></li></ul></div></div></div></main></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Coded with ‚ù§Ô∏è by Luca Tardito</div></div></div></footer></div>

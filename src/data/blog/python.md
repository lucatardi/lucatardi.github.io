## Variables

---

To create (declare) a variable in Python we don't need any keyword. We just need to specify the name of it and assign it a value after the `=` symbol.
Let's declare some variables with the ingredients of our Pythonmisù:

```py:ingredients.py
mascarpone_cheese = '750g'
sugar = '120g'
eggs = 5
espresso = 'just enough'
cocoa_powder = 'just enough'
```

## Comments

---

We can add comment in Python by adding the symbol `#` at the beginning of the line.
Let's add a comment for how many people these ingredients are:

```py:ingredients.py
# Serving for 30cm x 20cm tray
mascarpone_cheese = '750g'
sugar = '120g'
eggs = 5
espresso = 'just enough'
cocoa_powder = 'just enough'
```

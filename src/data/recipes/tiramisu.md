## Ingredients:
Serving for 30cm x 20cm tray:

- 120g Sugar
- 5 Eggs
- Malted milk biscuits
- 8 Espresso coffees
- Cocoa powder

---

## Preparation Process:
**Prepare the Coffee**: Make the espresso coffees and set them aside to cool down.
  
**Whip Egg Whites**: Separate the eggs. Mix half of the sugar with the egg whites until you get a firm foam.

**Mix Egg Yolks**: Mix the rest of the sugar with the egg yolks.

**Combine Mascarpone**: Add the mascarpone cheese to the yolk and sugar mixture, and mix until well combined.

**Incorporate Egg Whites**: Gently fold the egg white foam into the mascarpone mixture using slow, down-up movements.

**Assemble Tiramisu**:
Spread 3-4 spoons of the mascarpone cream on the tray to create a thin base layer.
Briefly soak the biscuits in the cooled espresso and lay them down to create a layer.
Spread a 1-2 cm layer of mascarpone cream over the biscuits.
Repeat the layers of soaked biscuits and cream until you use all the ingredients, ending with a layer of cream.

**Finish**: Garnish the top layer with a dusting of cocoa powder.

Refrigerate the tiramisu for several hours, preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld. Enjoy!

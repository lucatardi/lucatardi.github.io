**Mix Egg Yolks**: Mix the rest of the sugar with the egg yolks.

**Assemble Tiramisu**:
Spread 3-4 spoons of the mascarpone cream on the tray to create a thin base layer.
Briefly soak the biscuits in the cooled espresso and lay them down to create a layer.
Spread a 1-2 cm layer of mascarpone cream over the biscuits.
Repeat the layers of soaked biscuits and cream until you use all the ingredients, ending with a layer of cream.

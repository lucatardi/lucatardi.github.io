### About me
Hello there üëã
I am an Italian guy enjoying my life in Dublin. Where during the weekdays I work as a software developer for [Travelport](https://www.travelport.com/) and during the weekends I travel and explore new places. Between one line of code and one flight I like to cook traditional Italian dishes. Oh yes.. and I love penguins üêß.

### My story
I like to think about my life as a set of chapters where each one wrap a specific moment or experience I had defying who I am at the present day.

#### Chapter 1. The origin
I grew up in a small town called [Carcare](https://goo.gl/maps/FjzhLesAgsbWASZ36) where life is simple and slow and I believe that growing up there help me a lot to appraciate everything in life.
One of my granpa was a pastry chef and my other granpa owned a bakery at somepoint in his life, I was that fascinated by their creationsand stories that I decided to enroll a bakery school as part as my secondary studies. 

#### Chapter 2. Route recalculation
During summer time between the forth and the last year of school I found a job in one of the few bakery in my town, at the beginning I really enjoyed but only after a few weeks I could not stand anymore the permanent smell I had on my uniform and the almost none human interactions I had during my shift so I decided that was not the carrer for me. Before finishing the school my mom was helping out in a small bar and reastaurant which, she told me they were selling. 

#### Chapter 3. The challenge
It was 2009 beginning of a huge economic crysis and I was just 18 when I thought to acquire that business and thanks to the support and the trust that my dad has always being giving to me during my life I was able to successfully apply for the mortgage and complete the purchase.
The challenge was on, I was still wrapping up my secondary school in the mornings and after that going directly to the bar and start to work there until closing time. After the school was over I felt like to have a bit of free time during my mornings and I ended up to spend my time in finding ways to innovate the business, we started to organize special dinners and karaoke nights. I was the one monitoring the karaoke activity, investing time in finding the tracks with the best quality and the best programm to use for it. This actually was really my first contact with technology, 

#### Chapter 3. The switch
I remember at some point I decided to explore the possibilily of creating a website for the Bar. I found an online course on YouTube showing how to create a very basic website with a few pages and give a few colours at it and that's what I did. After a few weeks the website was on the owner of another restaurant asked me if I could do the same for his business so I remember I charged here 100‚Ç¨ for it. I fell in love for these colourful lines of code and I decided I should try to point my carrear to that direction. 

#### Chapter 3. A new challenge
I got an appointment to have some information about a private university which was providing a software and automation engineering course and would allow me to study from home and attend the exams only. The meeting was not really good as the lady after asking a few background questions told me that would be really difficutlt for me even to understand the first lessions given the fact I did a bakery school. I remember I felt the effect of these words but even more I felt my father saying "You always archive what you want to" these words gave me a boost to start the university, studying in the mornings and working in the afternoons and evenings. 

#### Chapter 4. Hard time
After a few months of studying I was ready and confident to give three exams: Math 1, Math 2 and English. I failed all of them, I was devasted and took me a few hours to get back on track and find an engineer to get private lessions from him. after that I was able to slowly progress exam after exam, the university was taking me 5 years instead of the planned 3 years. It was hard to work and study at the same time, I had to merge my social life with my working one inviting my friends to karaoke nights at the bar in order to be able to see my friends at least while I was working.
When I was really closo to the finish line I remember I went to Milan for an interview for an intership at [Atos](https://atos.net/en/) the interview was not really good as the interviewer made me feel unconfortable talking about not having enough experience for the role. At that time I did not know, only after I realized this was a really commun pattern in intership interviews in Italy.

#### Chapter 4. A new hope
A few days later I was at the university waiting for another exam to start and I read a brochure talking about Dublin as the eutopean sylicon valley with enterprise companies having hard time to find software engineers. In that moment I thought that moving to Dublin was the fastest way to a successful carrear.
I was able to sell the bar, which by the way it is still open and you can find it [here](https://goo.gl/maps/5H49EppecEMUtHEC7), complete the studies and get my degree and after tree days of my celebration moving to Dublin.
